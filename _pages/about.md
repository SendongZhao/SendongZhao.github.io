I am an Associate Professor and Ph.D. Supervisor at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). I also serve as the Assistant Director at the HIT Institute for NLP. I am recognized as a Distinguished Young Scholar of Heilongjiang Province. My academic journey includes postdoctoral research at Cornell University and a joint Ph.D. program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests primarily focus on foundational issues in NLP and AI for medicine, such as Large Language Models, AI-integrated medical consultations, clinical NLP, model interpretability, and AI-assisted drug discovery. I have published over 50 research papers in relevant fields, including one that got an honorable mention for the Best Paper Award at ACL 2023.
From 2018 to 2020, I conducted postdoctoral research at Cornell University, working with Professor [Fei Wang](https://wcm-wanglab.github.io/). I completed my Ph.D. at the HIT Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval in 2018, under the supervision of Professor Ting Liu. From 2015 to 2016, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at UIUC, under the guidance of Professor [ChengXiang Zhai](https://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/).
